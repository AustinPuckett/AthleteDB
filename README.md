# AthleteDB
A workout tracking application built with tkinter and sqlite3.

This project was built using a Model-View-Presenter architecture in tkinter. 

The AppController controls which presenter is active and also manages the root window. The presenter is responsible for placing the view on the root window and relaying information from the view to the model and vice versa.
